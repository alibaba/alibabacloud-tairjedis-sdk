This document describes the destructive changes brought about by upgrading alibabacloud-tairjedis-sdk from version 3.x to version 5.x. Since Jedis [4.x](https://github.com/redis/jedis/blob/master/docs/3to4.md) and [5.x](https://github.com/redis/jedis/blob/master/docs/breaking-5.md) bring many incompatible upgrades, alibabacloud-tairjedis-sdk itself depends on Jedis, so destructive changes are inevitable, but our adaptation principle is to minimize user code changes.

1. The dependent class needs to modify the import path.
- `import redis.clients.jedis.ScanParams;` to `import com.aliyun.tair.jedis3.ScanParams;`
- `import redis.clients.jedis.ScanResult;` to `import com.aliyun.tair.jedis3.ScanResult;`
- `import redis.clients.jedis.GeoUnit;` to `import redis.clients.jedis.args.GeoUnit;`
- `import redis.clients.jedis.params.Params;` to `import com.aliyun.tair.jedis3.Params;`

2. Some methods deleted by Jedis need to use Jedis3BuilderFactory.
- `BuilderFactory.BYTE_ARRAY_MAP` to `Jedis3BuilderFactory.BYTE_ARRAY_MAP`

3. The usage of Pipeline has changed.

The original one is as follows:
```java
TairHashPipeline pipeline = new TairHashPipeline();
pipeline.setClient(jedis.getClient());
pipeline.set("xx", "yy");
pipeline.sync();
```
The new one is as follows:
```java
TairHashPipeline pipeline = new TairHashPipeline(jedis);
pipeline.set("xx", "yy");
pipeline.sync();
```
